<b>Overview</b> <br>
Every morning, the app will ask the user to write down a single goal for the day and the 3 tasks that will help them achieve it.<br>
<br>
If the goal from the previous day was not achieved, it will be offered for the current day.<br>
<br>
Tasks and goals can be modified during the day. Only the most recent modification  for each day will be stored.<br>
<br>
The user will receive scheduled check-ins from the app asking them to mark the taskâ€™s progress.<br>
<br>
When the user completes one of the tasks, the app will perform a small "congrats" animation. When the user marks the goal as "achieved", the app will mark all of the tasks as<br> "completed" and will perform a more impressive "congrats" animation. If the user completes all of the tasks, the app will automatically mark the goal as "completed", but it will also<br> provide the user with the option to mark the goal as "not yet achieved".<br>
